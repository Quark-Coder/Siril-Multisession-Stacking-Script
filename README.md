# Siril-Multisession-Stacking-Script

### This script allows you to:
1. Combine astrophoto sessions from different nights with their calibration frames.
2. Save space on your computer.

The script is still very raw, so be careful,** since its behavior when bugs occur can be very different from what it was designed for.**

## **Save images before using it!** 
Immediately report any bug or idea that you would like to fix or add to this project.
